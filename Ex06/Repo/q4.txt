a.	x=no
	
	f is the function(a, b)
	x is undefined so it's set to a (= 'no')
	returns 'no'

b.	x=maybe

	same as (a.) but with the word 'maybe' instead of 'no'

c.	x=incorrectly

	when function(a, b) is called, x is no longer undefined, but because g's x
	was changed to maybe.
	b is undefined
	c is defined as 'incorrectly' so x is set to = c.
	returns 'incorrectly'
	
d.	x=arguably

	x calls line 6
	on line 8 we return x which is defined on line 22 as arguably

e.	x=impossibly

	similarly to (c.), f's x is now defined and therefore we return impossibly as
	defined for c on line on line 18

f.	x=undoubtedly

	on line 31 we change x to be undoubtedly.
	when we call line 36 we change b to equal this.x (line 8)
	when we return function(a, b) x is defined, and b is defined as x
	therefore we return b = undoubtedly
